Big Data is a term used to describe the exponential growth in the volume, velocity, and variety of data generated by various sources such as social media,
 web applications, and internet of things. The processing of big data is a challenging task for traditional data processing methods, which were designed to
 work with structured data with a small size. MapReduce is a programming model that is used to process large datasets in parallel on distributed computing 
systems. In this literature review, we will discuss the use of MapReduce for big data processing and its impact on data science and analytics.

Overview of MapReduce:
MapReduce is a programming model developed by Google to process large datasets in parallel on distributed computing systems. It consists of two phases: 
the Map phase and the Reduce phase. In the Map phase, the input data is divided into several chunks, and each chunk is processed in parallel by 
a map function. The map function takes the input data and produces intermediate key-value pairs. In the Reduce phase, the intermediate key-value pairs are
 grouped by key, and each group is processed in parallel by a reduce function. The reduce function takes the group of intermediate key-value pairs and 
produces the final output.

Impact of MapReduce on Big Data Processing:
MapReduce has revolutionized the field of big data processing by providing a scalable and fault-tolerant approach to processing large datasets. It allows
 data scientists and analysts to process terabytes and petabytes of data on distributed computing systems without worrying about the underlying hardware 
infrastructure. MapReduce also enables the processing of unstructured data such as text, images, and videos, which was not possible with traditional 
data processing methods.

One of the major advantages of MapReduce is its ability to process data in parallel, which allows for faster processing times. MapReduce also provides 
fault-tolerance, which ensures that if a node in the distributed computing system fails, the processing can continue without any loss of data. Additionally,
 MapReduce provides a simple and easy-to-use programming model that allows developers to focus on the data processing logic rather than the underlying 
hardware infrastructure.

Applications of MapReduce:
MapReduce has been used in various applications such as web search, social media analysis, and bioinformatics. One of the most well-known applications of
 MapReduce is the Hadoop framework, which is an open-source implementation of the MapReduce programming model. Hadoop is widely used in the industry for 
big data processing and has enabled the development of many data-intensive applications.

Conclusion:
MapReduce has had a significant impact on the field of big data processing by providing a scalable, fault-tolerant, and parallel processing approach to
 processing large datasets. Its ability to process unstructured data and its simple programming model have enabled data scientists and analysts to develop 
data-intensive applications that were not possible with traditional data processing methods. The future of big data processing will continue to rely on 
MapReduce and its evolution as new technologies and techniques emerge.
